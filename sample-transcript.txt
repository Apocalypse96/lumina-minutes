Team Meeting - Product Development
Date: December 15, 2024
Duration: 45 minutes

Attendees: Sarah (Product Manager), Mike (Lead Developer), Lisa (UX Designer), Tom (QA Engineer)

Sarah: Good morning everyone! Let's start our weekly product development meeting. Mike, can you give us an update on the current sprint progress?

Mike: Sure! We're about 70% complete with the current sprint. The user authentication module is finished and tested. The dashboard redesign is in progress - Lisa and I have been working closely on that. We should have it ready for testing by Wednesday.

Lisa: Yes, the new dashboard design is looking great. We've improved the user flow significantly. I've created mockups for the mobile version as well. The main changes include a cleaner navigation structure and better visual hierarchy.

Tom: I've started testing the authentication module. So far, it's working well. I found a few minor UI issues that I'll document in the bug tracker. The core functionality is solid.

Sarah: Excellent! What about the timeline for the next sprint? We need to start planning for the analytics features.

Mike: We can definitely start the analytics work in the next sprint. The current sprint will wrap up on Friday, and we can begin planning the next one on Monday. I estimate the analytics module will take about 3 weeks.

Lisa: I agree with that timeline. I'll need about a week to design the analytics dashboard, then Mike can start development while I work on the user research for the next feature set.

Tom: I'll need to set up automated testing for the analytics features. That might add a few days to the timeline, but it will save us time in the long run.

Sarah: Good point, Tom. Let's make sure we include that in our planning. Any other updates or concerns?

Mike: Just one thing - we might need to upgrade our database to handle the analytics queries efficiently. I'll research the options and get back to you by the end of the week.

Lisa: I have a question about the user feedback we received last week. Should we prioritize those changes in the next sprint?

Sarah: Let's review the feedback in detail during our planning session. Some of those changes might be quick wins we can squeeze in. Mike, can you prepare a rough estimate of effort for those items?

Mike: Will do. I'll analyze the feedback and provide estimates by Monday.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's wrap up here. Next meeting is Monday at 10 AM for sprint planning. Thanks everyone!
